## What is the Siren Grants Program

In order to promote a more vibrant community, the Siren Grants Program is proposed to push forward the decentralized development of the protocol. The goal is to provide support to projects seeking to further the development and decentralization, therefore grants will be provided to the following categories:
- Decentralization
- Usability
- Developer Tools

These being the core focus, there should also be two categories as a catch-all, one is for Siren Foundation defined projects or Request for Proposals (RFPs) as they are formally known in the non-degen world, the other is simply for Others. The latter being a category for community driven solutions that do not fit in the standard categories. 

## What are the goals for the categories?

In order to better define the focus areas.. please keep reading..
  
* **Decentralization**: Siren Markets is by definition a decentralized protocol. This decentralization can be defined based on several factors. One is application level integrations, [Liquity](https://www.liquity.org) is perhaps the best known example of this, in which their launch featured several application layer integrations and no-proprietary interface. Maximum distribution and decentralization will be achieved with many application intgegrations, this category aims to achieve this.
* **Usability**: Options by definition are complex financial instruments that are understood by advanced degens. A core factor in ensuring maximum decentralization is enabling usability of the protocol. This may be defined by software abstraction layers which enable greater utility of the application such as [Ribbon Finance](https://www.ribbon.finance) that bring options to a broader audience by simplifying the user experience.
* **Developer Tools**: Developer tools are important in order to enable greater innovation on Siren Protocol. Developer tools may be comprised of data analytics tools, command line interface tools, or other software based tooling that enables greater exploration and innovation on Siren Protocol.

## Siren Grants Program Work Flow

The Siren Grants Program will follow the SIP process as all proposals must go through a vote. 
[ WIP ] -> [ PROPOSED ] -> [ APPROVED ] -> [ IMPLEMENTED ] X [ REJECTED ] 

Each status change is requested by the grants author and reviewed by the SIP
editors. Use a pull request to update the status. Please include a link to where
people should continue discussing your SIP. The SIP editors will process these
requests as per the conditions below.

* **Work in progress (WIP)** -- Once the champion has asked the SIREN community
  whether an idea has any chance of support, they will write a draft SIP as a
[pull request]. Consider including an implementation if this will aid people in
studying the SIP.
* **Proposed** If agreeable, SIP editor will assign the SIP a number (generally
  the issue or PR number related to the SIP) and merge your pull request. The
SIP editor will not unreasonably deny an SIP. Proposed SIPs will be discussed on
governance calls and in Discord. If there is a reasonable level of consensus
around the change on the governance call the change will be moved to approved.
If the change is contentious a vote of token holders may be held to resolve the
issue or approval may be delayed until consensus is reached.
* **Approved** -- This SIP has passed community governance and is now being
  prioritised for development.
  
* **Implemented** -- This SIP has been implemented and deployed to mainnet.

* **Rejected** -- This SIP has failed to reach community consensus.
