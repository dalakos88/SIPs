<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>People wishing to submit SIPs, first should propose their idea or document to
the <a href="https://gov.sirenmarkets.com/">SIREN Governance Forum</a>.
After discussion, a PR can be opened at <a href="https://github.com/sirenmarkets/sips">github.com/sirenmarkets/sips</a>.
After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here as well as in the
GitHub repository.</p>

<p>The maintainers of the SIPs repository try to be fairly liberal when it
comes to approving them, and to not be too involved in decision making on
behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute
resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those
cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.</p>

<p>Having a SIP does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status
becomes Final or Active.</p>

<h2>Improvement Proposal Types</h2>

<p>Improvement proposals are separated into a number of types, and each has its own list.</p>

<h3><a href="{{"sips"|relative_url}}">SIPs</a>({{site.pages|where:"type","SIPs"|size}})</h3>
<p>SIP stands for SIREN Improvement Proposal, it has been adapted from the EIP
(Ethereum Improvement Proposal). The purpose of this process is to ensure
changes to SIREN are transparent and well governed. An SIP is a design document
providing information to the SIREN community about a proposed change to the
system. The author is responsible for building consensus within the community
and documenting dissenting opinions.</p>

<h3><a href="{{"sccps"|relative_url}}">SCCPs</a>({{site.pages|where:"type","SCCPs"|size}})</h3>
<p>SCCP stands for SIREN Configuration Change Proposal. SCCP's are documents for
making a case for modifying one of the system configuration variables. The
intent is to provide a clear and detailed history behind each configuration
change and the rationale behind it at the time it was implemented. The author of
the document is responsible for building consensus within the community and
documenting dissenting opinions.</p>
